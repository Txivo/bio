                    <h4>About me:</h4>



                        <P>this neil diamond song "i am i said" pretty much sums up alot about me.</P>


                        <p>L.A.'s fine, the sun shines most the time
                                And the feeling is "lay back"
                                Palm trees grow and rents are low
                                But you know I keep thinkin' about
                                Making my way back</p>

                        <p>Well I'm New York City born and raised But nowadays I'm lost between two shores L.A.'s fine, but it ain't home
                            New York's home But it ain't mine no more</p>

                        <p>"I am"... I said
                                To no one there
                                And no one heard at all
                                Not even the chair</p>

                        <p>"I am"... I cried
                                "I am"... said I
                                And I am lost and I can't
                                Even say why
                                Leavin' me lonely still</p>
                                

                        <p>Did you ever read about a frog
                                Who dreamed of bein' a king
                                And then became one
                                Well except for the names
                                And a few other changes
                                If you talk about me
                                The story is the same one</p>


                        <p>But I got an emptiness deep inside
                                And I've tried
                                But it won't let me go
                                And I'm not a man who likes to swear
                                But I never cared
                                For the sound of being alone</p>


                        <p>"I am"... I said
                                To no one there
                                And no one heard at all
                                Not even the chair
                                "I am"... I cried
                                "I am"... said I
                                And I am lost and I can't
                                Even say why
                                "I am"... I said
                                "I am"... I cried
                                "I am"</p>
